description: In 1991, I stumbled upon Jellyfish's Bedspring Kiss, a dreamy rumba hiding a tragic narrative. Here's why this forgotten track from Bellybutton still haunts me today.
---

It's 1991, and I think it must have been a Friday or Saturday, sometime in August. I remember this because just a few weeks later, I was set to leave for Germany to join the military orchestra.

That day, I walked into my local record shop to see if there were any new arrivals. The guy behind the counter had become a good friend, we shared a deep love for pop, rock, and folk music. He had an uncanny ability to recommend exactly the right albums, and this day was no exception.

As I stepped inside, he grinned and said, "You've got to hear this one, my friend..."

I glanced at the strange album cover as he told me it had come out a year earlier. The band was called Jellyfish, an American group blending pop, punk/funk, and '60s-style harmonies. I looked at him, smiled, and said, "Let me hear it, dude!"

As usual, he was right. I was blown away by the first three songs. I bought the record on the spot and sprinted home to hear the rest of the album.

About twenty minutes into the record, the eighth track began: _"Bedspring Kiss."_
It opened with a slow, swaying rhythm, a rumba, or at least something close to it. And by the time the song ended, I stopped the music.

I was overwhelmed, to be honest. There was something haunting in it, something that wrapped around me like a whispered secret.

I called my father in and asked if he could help me write down the lyrics. As we read through them together, I knew, I just knew, this was one of those songs that would stay with me for the rest of my life.

Before I explain why it hit me so hard, take a moment.
Read the lyrics for yourself.

Bedspring Kiss
--------------

Jimmy, his secret's out
The one he locked inside and denied every word about
He's guilty so his story claims
Twisting in his seat he repeats alone his name

Counting the words between his every line
Searchin' miles and miles to define
Just what it all means

Jimmy, as quiet as a church mouse
Painted every graphic scene but with few details
His accomplice had made sure of this
When she sealed it with a bedspring kiss
And when her time had come to go
Jimmy washed off the bloodstains form her clothes

But with a needle in his vein
He knew he could not explain
Just what it all means

Counting the words between his every line
Searchin' miles and miles to define
Just what it all means

Counting the words between his every line
Searchin' miles and miles to define
Just what it all means

Killing his time, a monkey in his vein
He knew he could not explain
Just what it all means
Just what it all means
```

I know lyrics often leave more unsaid than said and "Bedspring Kiss" is no exception. The song offers only fragments, glimpses of a larger story we're left to assemble ourselves. What we do know is this: there's a man named Jimmy, drifting through a quiet, fractured world, numbed by addiction and haunted by something he can't quite name.

Then there's her. A woman who enters the lyrics like a shadow, brief, unnamed, but central. We don't know exactly who she is, or what she means to Jimmy. But something passes between them, something intimate, maybe even tender, and it ends in blood. Violence is never directly shown, but it's there, heavy in the air. The imagery is hazy, like a memory blurred by time or drugs, but the feeling is unmistakable. And that's what stays with you.

Jimmy's "secret's out," the lyrics say. He's "guilty," though the nature of the crime is never made clear. It might be confession, or it might be something darker, self-blame, delusion, a looping internal monologue. The truth, whatever it is, remains tangled in metaphor and silence. A "bedspring kiss," bloodstains washed clean, and a needle in his vein. The lines between passion, regret, and destruction blur completely.

This isn't just a tale of a doomed romance, it feels more like a psychological spiral, a mind unraveling under the weight of trauma. Jimmy could have been involved in a woman's death, perhaps a lover or accomplice. Maybe it was consensual. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was an accident. But now, caught between memory and denial, all he can do is "count the words between his every line," unable to say the thing that matters most.

The emotional core of the song lives in that space, in the guilt, the sorrow, the numb confusion. It's not a murder ballad in the traditional sense. It's something more elusive, more tragic: the sound of a man who can no longer tell the difference between what he's done and what he's lost.

What makes "Bedspring Kiss" even more haunting is the music itself. That gentle, rumba-inspired rhythm, slow, swaying, almost romantic, feels like it belongs to a love song, something danced to under warm lights and soft shadows. The vocals are rich and aching, full of tenderness, as if crooning a lullaby to a fading memory. And yet, beneath that beauty, the story unfolds like a slow collapse. It's this tension, the dance of elegance and despair, that gives the song its power. A rhythm made for lovers, carrying the weight of guilt. A voice full of longing, telling a story that never fully dares to speak its name. It's this duality that mesmerized me then, and still does, all these years later.
