## I am an open-source contributor!

Not a big deal and my pull-request was a tiny update on some docs in the shadcn-svelte project, but hey: you gotta start somewhere, so still I'm kinda proud of myself ðŸ˜‰

On that note: have a look at that project, the maintainer build a awesome fork of shadcn-ui for svelte.
