description: A personal story about why we chose Albania for our holiday, and maybe more.
---

Ever since we got together, we've dreamt about moving abroad. You know, once the kids are old enough to make their own breakfast, wipe their own butts, and we're old enough to start counting how many summers we might have left...

Of course, we considered buying a house in Ukraine, but that's not looking very realistic. So one day I threw out the idea of Albania. To my surprise, luba loved it.

Albania ticks a lot of boxes for me: warm weather, amazing food, a mix of Christian and Muslim cultures, ancient Roman ruins, and houses that are still pretty affordable.

About a year ago, I stumbled upon a Facebook group and saw a few posts by a guy named Florian. He runs a kind of family BnB with his parents and sister, so I reached out. We had a great video chat, and by the end of it, I was convinced: we had to visit.

Fast-forward almost a year, and we've finally booked our stay: a full week at Florian's place.

### Why We Chose Florian's Place

What made us book this place, besides Florian being super welcoming over video, was the vibe. It's more than a bed and breakfast. It's a little oasis on the edge of Shkodër, surrounded by vineyards and gardens, run by Florian, his parents, and his sister.

🍇 **Homegrown everything**  
Most of the food comes straight from their land. Think fresh vegetables, homemade wine, raki, and bread baked that morning. Breakfast is flexible (no need to set alarms), and if you stay for dinner, expect a warm vegetarian feast served with stories and laughter. It's €10 for a full meal and a glass of wine. Honestly, not bad.

🚲 **Free bikes & Albanian countryside**  
You can borrow bikes and cycle into Shkodër in minutes. Or just coast past fields and breathe in that early-summer air.

🌞 **Eco-friendly & solar-powered**  
Showers are heated by the sun from April to September. It's rustic, yes, but there's something nice about knowing your hot water came from the sky.

👩‍🍳 **Cooking class with Florian's sister**  
Want to learn how to cook Albanian food the real way? Florian's sister is a trained chef and offers traditional cooking classes on-site. Tempted? Us too.

🗺️ **Adventures nearby**  
Whether it's hiking the Albanian Alps, horseback riding, or even crossing into Montenegro, Florian can hook you up with guides and help organize your whole trip. He runs a tour company on the side.

♿ **Accessible & down-to-earth**  
The guesthouse is wheelchair accessible and peaceful, with a gate that locks at 11 pm to keep things quiet at night. It's not luxury, it's family, comfort, and shared meals under the stars.

We're not going to Florian's for marble bathtubs or pillow menus. We're going for the homemade jam, the garden tomatoes, the smell of fresh bread, and maybe, just maybe, to fall a little in love with Albania.

### What We'll Spend for Two

| &nbsp;                         | Total cost     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| BNB with breakfast (7 nights)  | € 322,00       |
| Fly tickets                    | € 490,00       |
| Food / Drinks and other things | +/- € 700,00   |
|                                | **€ 1.512,00** |

Not bad for a week of sun, adventure, and scouting out what might one day be our second home.
