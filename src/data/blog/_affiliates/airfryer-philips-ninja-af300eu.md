description: Discover how the Philips Essential XL Airfryer quietly transformed our daily meals and our evenings together. A poetic, personal review bleding love, simplicity, and perfect crispiness.
---

We didn't buy it for health.  
Not for the buzzwords, "air instead of oil," "less fat," "smart kitchen."

We bought it because we were tired.  
Of dishes. Of clunky ovens. Of evenings that began with cleanup and ended with exhaustion.

And so we found it: the [**Philips Essential XL Connected Airfryer**](https://amzn.to/3FIPKdy), quiet, black, unassuming. Like a lover who doesn't need to shout to be noticed.

## üåø Why We Chose This One

It had to be **simple**, but not basic.  
**Large enough** for two hungry hearts, but not a countertop hog.  
**Smart enough** to preheat itself while we curled up on the couch, waiting for something crisp.

The Philips HD9285/90 checked every box:

- 6.2 liter capacity (yes, you can roast two salmon filets and still have room for fries)
- App-connected: recipes, timers, even remote cooking
- Quiet hum, no smoke, no drama

> Honestly? It seduced us. Quiet competence is sexy.

## üçü The First Night

We made garlic fries. Thin, tossed in olive oil and rosemary, crisped in 11 minutes.  
While they sizzled in their own hot air, we poured wine. She leaned back. I watched the timer.  
Something about cooking **without hovering**, it changed the mood.

We didn't rush. We fed each other fries like lovers on a dare.

## üçó What Came After

The next morning: croissants. Golden.  
Then: salmon. Sweet potato wedges. Even reheated pizza, and it was **better than fresh**.

She started calling it "The Third Wheel We Welcome."  
And honestly, I don't mind.

## üí° Unexpected Perks

- **No greasy pans**
- **No lingering smells**
- **No tension**, just "What shall we airfry tonight?"

Cooking became **foreplay**. Not in a vulgar way, but in that _"we're in this together"_ way.  
The airfryer made space. For laughter. For small touches. For connection.

## üîç What to Look For in an Airfryer

Before we chose ours, we looked for:

- **Capacity**: enough for two, or a small family
- **Ease of cleaning**: dishwasher-safe baskets
- **Noise level**: low hum, not a fan jet
- **Smart features**: timers, app control, auto shutoff

These features turned out to be more important than we imagined.

## üï∞ How It Fits Into Our Daily Routine

**Lunch**: Toss in frozen falafel, warm naan, some roasted veggies. Done.  
**Dinner**: Salmon with asparagus or pork chops with honey-glazed carrots.  
**Midnight**: Fries again. Or leftover pizza, crisped and reborn.

And always, always shared, leaning into each other, nibbling, laughing.

## üò≤ Things We Didn't Expect (But Loved)

- The **Philips NutriU app** is actually helpful, real recipes that don't suck
- **Toasting** burger buns, heavenly
- Cooking with no oil that still feels indulgent

## üîÅ Would We Recommend It?

Without hesitation.  
If you're tired, if you crave simplicity, or if you just want **evenings that begin with food and end in each other's arms**, yes.

> If you click and buy, I may earn a small commission, which I'll likely use to airfry halloumi next weekend.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Final Verdict + Alternatives

We considered cheaper models, some under ‚Ç¨80. But they felt flimsy, loud, or too small.  
We also looked at high-end ones with dual zones, overkill for two.

Philips found the **Goldilocks zone**: quality, quiet, capacity, and smart tech.

You can't go wrong with this one.  
Unless you burn your first fries. (You won't.)

## ü™û Closing Reflection

Sometimes, the smallest things shift the weight of your life.  
Sometimes, it's not a grand romance or a bold decision.  
Sometimes, it's just a machine in the kitchen humming softly, saying: _"I've got this, go be with her."_
